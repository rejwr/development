7 Habits of Highly Effective Programmers
1. Movement is important for the body, especially at work, where you sits most of the time.
This includes in particular software engineers. In the long term, it is necessary to regularly
stretch the body or create a desk setup similar to the Linus Torvalds office equipment.
2. When developing a new part of the system, it is necessary to focus on the main functionality
of the program and not get stuck when fixing a small bug. If we spend a lot of time correcting a small bug,
the main goal of the sprint will not be finished. If we get stuck creating one program function,
sometimes it's better to start over.
3. In programming is necessary to create code simply so that the code is also readable by other programmers.
It is possible to create code using some design patterns.
